### 1. Why should I use Prime Launch for my token sale?
Prime Launch offers two launch types:
1. Seed Launches, perfect for controlled, initial fund raising.
2. Liquid Launches (coming soon), ideal for larger public offerings optimized for fair price points and reduced frontrunning.

Prime Launch is also owned and operated by a DAO, Prime DAO, which comes with a number of benefits (decentralization, stakeholder ownership, transparency). When you use Prime Launch, the Prime Network is buying into your launch and makes a number of other services and products available to you, such as shared liquidity pooling, R&D, developing, and communications support (see the <a href="https://forum.prime.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prime Forum</a>).

### 2. How is Prime Launch governed and operated? Who owns Prime Launch?
Prime Launch is owned and operated by Prime DAO, which funded Prime Launch's development and appoints the signers on the Prime Launch multi-sig. The multi-sig is responsible for approving new launches to appear in the Prime Launch interface.

### 3. Can I request support services from Prime DAO without launching on Prime Launch?
Yes! You can inquire about them in the <a href="https://forum.prime.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prime Forum</a>.

### 4. How can I get in touch with the core Prime Launch team?
Reach out in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/x8v59pG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prime Discord</a>.
