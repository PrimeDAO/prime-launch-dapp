Prime Launch is a platform for hosting decentralized token launches on Ethereum. 
 - Project teams and DAOs can use Prime Launch to seamlessly distribute tokens and attract resources. 
 - Users looking to acquire tokens can get access to curated Web 3.0 projects that have been verified by a permissionless process, ensuring only top-quality projects are listed. 

## The challenge: IDOs are a hostile frontier

With the advancement of decentralized finance, an increasing number of crypto projects have shifted from listing tokens on centralized exchanges to listing on decentralized exchanges. With this transition, new mechanisms for market-making and token offerings have emerged, collectively called Initial Decentralized Offerings (IDOs) . These mechanisms have removed many frictions from the industry, as projects no longer need to wait (or pay) for centralized exchanges to list their assets. This has allowed a more diverse group of DeFi projects to emerge.

While IDOs remove some friction, they also create new challenges, namely: 

- Time / money costs of researching available IDO tools and potentially developing a custom interface and UX to host an IDO
- With some IDO protocols, a large amount of initial capital must be deployed by project teams to host the IDO — capital they may not have
- Potentially high transactions costs, making user participation more expensive than it would be on centralized exchanges
- Exploits like <a href="https://www.bitcoinsuisse.com/research/decrypt/arbitrage-and-frontrunning-in-defi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frontrunning</a> and <a href="https://hackernoon.com/no-sandwich-please-popular-defi-attack-strategy-analysis-jk1734rf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sandwich attacks</a>.
- Lack of curation, or poor curation, on the part of decentralized exchange interfaces, leading to many projects that raise funds from contributors only to "rug pull" or exit before delivering the product

## Prime Launch's solution

Prime Launch provides token-launchers with ready-to-go launch infrastructure: smooth UX, low initial capital requirements, well-curated project lists, and a relevant network of users. 

All official Prime Launches must be submitted through the <a href="/documentation/application-process">application process</a> and are curated by PrimeDAO to ensure the quality of listed projects.

### Launch options

There are two methods for hosting a Prime Launch:

🌱 <a href="/documentation/seed-launch">Seed Launch</a> allows early stage projects to host a launch without needing to pre-allocate any resources and with the ability to select which contributors are able to participate.

🌊 <a href="/documentation/liquid-launch">Liquid Launch</a> leverages the <a href="https://docs.balancer.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Balancer V2</a> infrastructure. It uses a novel token distribution mechanism, the Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool, to disincentive large contributors from buying all tokens in one go and to punish bots, leading to more fair and accessible distribution. 

Another benefit of Liquid Launches is Balancer's rewards protocol: users of the protocol receive BAL tokens to make up for any transaction costs. This means that up to 90% of your transaction costs when participating in Liquid Launches will be reimbursed in the form of BAL tokens.
