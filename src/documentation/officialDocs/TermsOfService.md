**Terms & Conditions**

Please read these Terms carefully before participating on our launch platform. These Terms tell you who we are, what we offer, what to do if there is a problem, and other important information. If you think that there is a mistake in these Terms, please contact us to discuss at forum.prime.xyz

**WHO WE ARE AND HOW TO CONTACT US**

1.1. Prime Launch is operated by PrimeDAO ("We"). We are an Ethereum based organisation managed by community members. To contact us, please write to us via the Prime Launch subcategory of forum.prime.xyz

1.2. We use open source products and developer materials from Balancer Labs, Prime Development Foundation and affiliated (legal) persons ("Affiliates"), as well as from other third parties to provide a platform (the "Platform") to interact with different protocols, such as the Balancer Protocol (together: the "Protocol"). The Platform is autonomous, and acts independently from the providers of Protocol.

**WE PROVIDE A PLATFORM TO INTERACT WITH THIRD PARTY PROTOCOLS**

2.1. The Platform is a graphical user interface that facilitates interacting with different Protocols for ERC20 tokens. 

2.2. The Protocols are governed by a series of smart contracts between users without the need for intermediaries on Ethereum Mainnet, and that have Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanisms. 

2.3. We are not a custodian, nor a counterparty to any transactions executed by you on the Protocol and the Platform. We do not provide any order matching, guaranteed prices, or similar exchange or trading platform services. 

**BY USING OUR PLATFORM, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS**

3.1. These general terms and conditions ("Terms") apply to the use of our Platform.

3.2. By using our Platform, you confirm that you accept and agree to these Terms.

3.3. You will ensure that all persons who access or use our Platform through your device or internet connection are aware of, and will comply with these Terms.

3.4. We will amend these Terms regularly, at our sole discretion. Before each use of our Platform, please check the most recent Terms.

3.5. We may terminate or suspend your access to our Platform immediately, without prior notice or liability, if you breach any clause of the Terms. Upon termination of your access, your right to use the Platform will immediately cease. Clauses 7 through 20 survive termination of these Terms.

3.6. You may have been referred to the Platform by a third party. We are not liable for any agreement or terms that may exist between you and such third party.

**WHAT YOU NEED TO USE OUR PLATFORM**

4.1. A detailed step-by-step guide on how to use the Platform can be found in the [Prime Liquid Launch (LBP) Guide](https://medium.com/primedao/prime-liquid-launch-lbp-guide-d8cd22c6336c).

4.2	To use the Platform, you need:

4.2.1. A wallet compatible with the Ethereum Blockchain or Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanisms. We currently only support MetaMask, Torus and WalletConnect compatible wallets. We have not tested compatibility with any other wallets.

4.2.2. An ERC 20 token for participation in a launch. 

4.2.3. Depending on whether you interact with Prime Launch on Ethereum Mainnet or Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanisms, sufficient ETH must be in your Wallet to pay for transactions fees, which are incurred through the Protocol and on the Blockchain.

**FEES LEVIED BY US**

5.1. We do not currently levy any fees on users who participate in a launch on Prime Launch.

5.2. The Protocol might require a contribution of any kind, if so described.

5.3. Users interacting with the Ethereum Mainnet or Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanisms will incur transaction costs. Transaction costs are independent of the Platform and go to miners processing the transaction on the networks. We have no control over and do not set the transaction costs, nor do we benefit from these. The Platform does not change the default suggestion of your wallet provider. Users may be able to change the default transaction fee within their wallet, depending on the wallet used.

**YOUR CRYPTOGRAPHIC ASSETS**

6.1. You must own and fully control the wallet you use in connection with our Platform.

6.2.

By using our Platform, we do not gain custody of any of your private keys.

6.3. We are not responsible for any security measures relating to the wallet you use for the Platform and exclude (to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law) any and all liability for any security breaches or other acts or omissions, which result in your loss of access or custody of any cryptographic assets stored thereon.

**YOUR TAX LIABILITIES**

7.1. You are solely responsible to determine if your use of the Platform has tax implications for you. You agree not to hold us liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from the operation of the Platform or any other action or transaction related thereto.

Any modification to or deletion of a provision or part-provision under this clause shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the rest of these Terms.

**APPENDIX**

**RISKS**

**PRICE FLUCTUATIONS**

ERC20 tokens are neither legal tender backed by governments nor by assets. The tokens' value is highly volatile causing price fluctuations, as auctions typically run for some time and trades are not executed instantly.

**REGULATORY ACTION**

We could be impacted by regulatory inquiries or action, which could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Platform.

**TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING**

Cryptographic assets are described in technical language requiring a comprehensive understanding of computer science and mathematics to appreciate the inherent risks.

TRANSACTIONS ON ETHEREUM MAINNET AND ETHEREUM VIRTUAL MACHINE COMPATIBLE VALIDATION MECHANISMS ARE IMMUTABLE AND IRREVERSIBLE
Transactions on Ethereum Mainnet and Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanisms are generally immutable and irreversible. Any transaction thereon is therefore irrevocable and final as soon as it is settled thereon. In the event that you send your tokens to sell to any other destination other than the Protocol smart contracts, such tokens may not be returned. We assume no responsibility and shall have no obligation to you if this occurs, including but not limited to any responsibility to recover, or assist to recover, any such tokens.

**FAILURES WITHIN DATA STORAGE SYSTEMS**

Our Platform may in part be established on servers at data centre facilities of third party providers and on distributed systems for storing and accessing data including IPFS. Where centralised services may be used, we may be required to transfer our Platform to different facilities, and may incur service interruption in connection with such relocation. Data centre facilities are vulnerable to force majeure events or other failures. Third party providers may suffer breaches of security and others may obtain unauthorised access to our server data. Where content is stored via distributed systems, there may be interference in content addressing, content linking, indexing and discovery. As techniques used to obtain unauthorised access change frequently and generally are not recognised until used against a target, it may not be possible to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.
