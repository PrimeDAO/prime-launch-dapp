A Seed Launch is a token offering by an early-stage project to a small group of contributors, in order to raise initial resources for the venture.

Seeds use a **fixed swap function**: contributors can swap the funding token for the seed token at a fixed, **pre-determined price**. 

Project teams may also **specify which addresses will be allowed to contribute** to their Seed. This whitelist functionality mimics many of the dynamic of a traditional private offering (except the privacy, obviously). 

Seed Launches may also include a token **vesting schedule for contributors**, including both a cliff (lock) and a linear vesting period. This means the project team can specify: 

1) **cliff**: an amount of time during which contributors who have received tokens cannot transfer them.

2) **vest**: an amount of time, beginning after the cliff, during which a contributor's purchased tokens unlock linearly.

**Benefits**

- ***decentralized*** — decentralized infrastructure, run by a DAO
- ***simple*** — pre-determined maximum amount raised & quantity of tokens sold
- ***whitelist*** — projects can optionally allow only whitelisted contributors
- ***vesting*** — settable cliffs and vesting schedules for contributors
