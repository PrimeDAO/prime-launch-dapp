A Seed Launch is a token offering by an early-stage project to a small group of contributors, in order to raise initial resources for the venture.

Seeds use a fixed swap function: contributors can swap the funding token for the seed token at a fixed, pre-determined price. 

Project teams may also specify which addresses will be allowed to contribute to their Seed. This whitelist functionality mimics some of the dynamics of a traditional private offering (except the privacy, obviously). 

Seed Launches may also include a token vesting schedule for contributors, including both a cliff (lock) and a linear vesting period. This means the project team can specify: 

1) **Cliff**: an amount of time during which contributors who have received tokens cannot transfer them.

2) **Vest**: an amount of time, beginning after the cliff, during which a contributor's purchased tokens unlock linearly.

## Benefits

- **Decentralized** — Prime Launch uses decentralized infrastructure and is run by a DAO
- **Simple** — pre-determined maximum amount raised & quantity of tokens sold
- **Whitelist** — projects can optionally allow only whitelisted contributors
- **Vesting** — settable cliffs and vesting schedules for contributors
